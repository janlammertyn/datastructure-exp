3 raw data files: They are the output of the C-script.

1. aadata.rtd = data of aa training task: 
It contains 9 variables: 
ppn (= participant number)	
mv (=sex of participant)
trial (=trail number)
blk (=block number)
tfac (=type of face: 1 = approached face, 2 = avoided fice)
sze (=size of presentation of face stimulus)	
face (= which specific face was used: 8 possible faces: 4 male, 4 female)
rt (=reaction time)	
re (= delay in presentation of face in microsecond due to processing of computer)

2. explicitdata.rtd = data of explicit questions we asked participants: 
In total it contains 81 variables: 
pp (=participant number) 
order (= 0 or 1: first implicit measure than explicit = 1)
0nr (= for face 1: on what place was the face presented in the instruction screen: <5 = approached, >4 = avoided)
0ty (= for face 1: what was the type: approached/avoided)
0ca (= for face 1: was participant aware of contingency?)
0ra (= for face 1: what was liking rating? )
0vr (= for face 1: what was friendliness rating? )
0ac (= for face 1: what action did he indicate he had performed: 1 : approach, 2= avoid, 3= both actions equal)
0ze (= for face 1: how certain was participant that he had performed that action ?) 
0pct (= for face 1: what was percentage ?)
--> the same variable for all faces: e.g. 3nr = for face 4: on what place presented in instruction screen,...
oft (= answer to question: do you think you performed all actions for each face equally often? )
w1 - 10: resistance variables 

3. primedata.rtd = data of evaluative priming task: 
It contains 14 variables: 
ppn (= participant number)	
mv (=sex of participant)
trial (=trail number)
blk (=block number)
hnd (= 1 or 2: counterbalancing of left/right button press to positive/negative target response) 
tfac (=type of face: 1 = approached face, 2 = avoided fice)
fac (= which specific face was used: 8 possible faces: 4 male, 4 female)
prmt ( =presentation time of prime)
ttype (=targettype= 0 is negative, 1 is positive)
xr (= correct response option)
r (= given response)
cor (= correctness of response: 0 or 1)
rt (=reaction time)	
re (= delay in presentation of face in microsecond due to processing of computer)
target (=which specific target: e.g., the word 'vriendelijk',...)
