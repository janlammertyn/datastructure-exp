Procedure: 

1. Participants are seated at computer and sign informed consent. 
2. Participants are informed that instructions are always presented on screen and that they can now start the experiment.  
3. Participants perform experiment (see below)
4. Participants fill in debriefing questions (debriefing.docx)
5. Participants receive payment (5euros) + are thanked for participation.
--> duration of experiment approximately 25 minutes

Experiment presentation: 

To run experiment: open file exp_AAexperiment.c with Crimson editor --> compile (F9) and run (F10). 

Stimuli: 

- Pictures of 8 different faces in 5 different sizes
   e.g., bmp001s1 = face of male 1 (m1) in size 1 (480x640)
           bmp005s2 = face of female 1 (f1) in size 2 (456x608)
- Stimuli for evaluative priming task: 6 positive words (see poswords.txt) and 6 negative words (see negwords.txt)
