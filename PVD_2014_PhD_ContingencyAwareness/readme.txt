In this study we set out to investigate whether exemplar-based approach-avoidance training effects depend on awareness of stimulus-action contingencies. 

Procedures were based on studies by Vandenbosch & De Houwer and Woud, Becker & Rinck that provided mixed evidence for exemplar-based approach-avoidance training effects: 

   - Vandenbosch, K., & De Houwer, J. (2011). Failures to induce implicit evaluations by means of approach-avoid training. Cognition and Emotion, 25, 1311-1330. doi: 10.1080/02699931.2011.596819
   - Woud, M. L., Becker, E. S., & Rinck, M. (2008). Implicit evaluation bias induced by approach and avoidance. Cognition and Emotion, 22, 1187-1197. doi: 10.1080/02699930801906843



Our study is composed of two experiments which both included 64 participants recruited from experimetrix. 

Our main finding was that AA training effects were moderated by contingency awareness.

All details of the procedure and results can be found in the published manuscript-file which can be found in dissemination folder under publications.
